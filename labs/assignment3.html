  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
  This assignment helps you develop a detailed understanding of the
  calling stack organization on an x86 processor.&nbsp; It involves applying
  a series of <i>buffer overflow attacks</i> on an executable file.&nbsp;
  </p><p>
  <b>Note:</b>&nbsp; In this lab, you will gain first-hand experience with one
  of the methods commonly used to exploit security weaknesses in
  operating systems and network servers.&nbsp; Our purpose is to help you
  learn about the run-time operation of programs and to understand the
  nature of this form of security weakness so that you can avoid it
  when you write system code.&nbsp; We <i>vigorously condemn</i> the use of
  these or any other form of attack to gain unauthorized access to any
  system resources.&nbsp; There are criminal statutes governing such
  activities.&nbsp;
  
  <p>
  </p><h2>Due Dates</h2>
  <p>
  For the main assignment: 11:59pm, Tuesday, March 23.&nbsp;
  </p>

  </p><h2>Location of the Bomb</h2>
  <p>
  To obtain a bomb, point your browser at
  <a href="http://cycle3.csug.rochester.edu:18213/">
  http://cycle3.csug.rochester.edu:18213/</a>.&nbsp;
  (This will work only for browsers running on a csug machine.)&nbsp;
  You’ll end up downloading a <code>tar</code> file which, when unpacked,
  will give you a set of three programs:&nbsp;
  </p><dl>
  <dt><code>makecookie</code> </dt><dd>Generates a “cookie” based
      on your team name.&nbsp;
  </dd><dt><code>bufbomb</code> </dt><dd>The code you will attack.&nbsp;
  </dd><dt><code>hex2raw</code> </dt><dd>A utility to help convert between string
      formats.&nbsp;
  </dd></dl>
  All of these programs are compiled to run on the csug machines.&nbsp;
  
  <h2>Team Name and Cookie</h2>
  <p>
  You should create a team name for the one or two people in your group
  of the following form:&nbsp;
  </p><dl>
  <dt> “name” </dt><dd>where name is your username, if you are
      working alone, or
  </dd><dt> “name1” </dt><dd>where name1 is the username of the
      first team member. <font color="red">Email the grad TAs the team members.</font>&nbsp;
  </dd></dl>
  
  <!--You should choose a consistent ordering of the IDs in the second form
  of team name.&nbsp; Teams “bob+jane” and “jane+bob” are
  considered distinct.&nbsp; <b>You must follow this scheme for generating
  your team name (with the plus sign and no spaces!)&nbsp; Our grading program will only give credit to those
  people whose username can be extracted from the team names.</b>-->
  <p>
  A <i>cookie</i> is a string of eight hexadecimal digits that is (with high
  probability) unique to your team.&nbsp; You can generate your cookie with
  the <code>makecookie</code> program giving your name as the
  argument.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp;
  </p><pre>  unix&gt; <i>makecookie bob</i>
    0x39297273
  </pre>
  In three of your four buffer attacks, your objective will be to make
  your cookie show up in places where it ordinarily would not.&nbsp;
  
  <h2>The <code>bufbomb</code> Program</h2>
  <p>
  The <code>bufbomb</code> program reads a string from standard input with a
  function <code>getbuf</code> having the following C code:&nbsp;
  </p><pre>  int getbuf()
  {
    char buf[NORMAL_BUFFER_SIZE];
    Gets(buf);
    return 1;
  }
  </pre>
  The function <code>Gets</code> is similar to the standard library function
  <code>gets</code>.&nbsp; It reads a string from standard input (terminated by
  ‘\n’ or end-of-file) and stores it (along with a null
  terminator) at the specified destination.&nbsp; In this code, the
  destination is an array <code>buf</code> having sufficient space for 32
  characters.&nbsp;
  <p>
  Neither <code>Gets</code> nor <code>gets</code> has any way to
  determine whether there is enough space at the destination to store the
  entire string.&nbsp; Instead, they simply copy the entire string, possibly
  overrunning the bounds of the storage allocated at the destination.&nbsp;
  </p><p>
  If the string typed by the user to <code>getbuf</code> is no more than 31
  characters long, it is clear that <code>getbuf</code> will return 1, as shown
  by the following execution example:&nbsp;
  </p><pre>  unix&gt; <i>bufbomb -u bovik</i>
    Type string:&nbsp; <i>howdy doody</i>
    Dud: getbuf returned 0x1
  </pre>
  If we type a longer string, typically an error occurs:
  <pre>  unix&gt; <i>bufbomb -u bovik</i>
    Type string: <i>This string is too long</i>
    Ouch!: You caused a segmentation fault!
  </pre>
  As the error message indicates, overrunning the buffer typically
  causes the program state to be corrupted, leading to a memory access
  error.&nbsp; Your task is to be more clever with the strings you feed
  <code>bufbomb</code> so that it does more interesting things.&nbsp; These are
  called <i>exploit</i> strings.&nbsp;
  <p>
  Note:&nbsp; This version of the lab has been specially modified to defeat the
  stack randomization techniques used by newer versions of Linux.&nbsp; It
  works by using <code>mmap()</code> and a bit of in-line assembly code to
  move the stack pointed at by <code>%esp</code> to an otherwise unused part
  of your address space.&nbsp;  You may need to use <code>gdb</code> to
  figure out where that is.&nbsp;
  </p><p>
  <code>Bufbomb</code> takes several command line arguments:&nbsp;
  </p><dl>
  <dt>–u <b>TEAM</b> </dt><dd>Operate the bomb for the indicated team.&nbsp;
      You should always provide this argument for several reasons:&nbsp;
  <ul>
  <li> It is required to log your successful attacks.&nbsp;
  </li><li> <code>Bufbomb</code> determines the cookie you will be using based
      on your team name, just as does the program <code>makecookie</code>.&nbsp;
  </li><li> We have built features into <code>bufbomb</code> so that some of
      the key stack addresses you will need to use depend on your
      team’s cookie.&nbsp;
  </li></ul>
  </dd><dt> –h </dt><dd>Print list of possible command line arguments
  </dd><dt> –n </dt><dd>Operate in “Nitro” mode, as is used in
      Level 4 below.&nbsp;
  </dd><dt> –s </dt><dd>Submit your solution exploit string to the grading server.&nbsp;
  </dd></dl>
  Your exploit strings will typically contain byte values that do not
  correspond to the ASCII values for printing characters.&nbsp; The program
  <code>hex2raw</code> can help you generate these <i>raw</i>
  strings.&nbsp;
  It takes as input a <i>hex-formatted</i> string.&nbsp; In this format, each
  byte value is represented by two hex digits.&nbsp; For example, the string
  “012345” could be entered in hex format as “30 31 32
  33 34 35” since the ASCII code for decimal digit 0 is 0x30 and so
  forth.&nbsp;
  <p>
  The hex characters you pass <code>hex2raw</code> should be separated by
  whitespace (blanks or newlines).&nbsp; I recommend separating different
  parts of your exploit string with newlines while you're working on
  it.&nbsp; <code>hex2raw</code> also supports C-style block comments, so you can
  mark off sections of your exploit string.&nbsp; For example:
  </p><pre>bf 66 7b 32 78 /* mov    $0x78327b66,%edi */
  </pre>
  Be sure to leave space around both the starting and ending comment strings (/*, */)
  so they will be properly ignored.&nbsp;
  <p>
  If you place a hex-formatted exploit string in the file
  <i>exploit.txt</i>, you can apply the raw string to <code>bufbomb</code>
  in at least two different ways:&nbsp;
  </p><ol>
  <li> You can set up a series of pipes to pass the string through
      <code>hex2raw</code>.&nbsp;
  <pre>  unix&gt; <i>cat exploit.txt</i> | <i>./hex2raw</i> | <i>./bufbomb -u bovik</i>
  </pre>
  </li><li> You can store the raw string in a file and use I/O redirection to
      supply it to <code>bufbomb</code>:&nbsp;
  <pre>  unix&gt; <i>./hex2raw &lt; exploit.txt &gt; exploit-raw.txt</i>
    unix&gt; <i>./bufbomb -u bovik &lt; exploit-raw.txt</i>
  </pre>
  </li></ol>
  This second approach can also be used when running <code>bufbomb</code>
  from within <code>gdb</code>:&nbsp;
  <pre>  unix&gt; <i>gdb bufbomb</i>
    (gdb) <i>run -u bovik &lt; exploit-raw.txt</i>
  </pre>
  One important point:&nbsp; your exploit string must not contain byte value
  <i>0x0A</i> at any intermediate position, since this is the ASCII code
  for newline (‘\n’).&nbsp; When <code>Gets</code> encounters this
  byte, it will assume you intended to terminate the string.&nbsp;
  <p>
  When you have correctly solved one of the levels, say level 0:
  </p><pre>    ../hex2raw &lt; smoke-bovik.txt | ../bufbomb -u bovik 
      Userid: bovik
      Cookie: 0x1005b2b7
      Type string:Smoke!: You called smoke()
      VALID
      NICE JOB!
  </pre>
  then you can submit your solution to the grading server using the <code>-s</code> option:
  <pre>    ./hex2raw &lt; smoke-bovik.txt | ./bufbomb -u bovik -s
      Userid: bovik
      Cookie: 0x1005b2b7
      Type string:Smoke!: You called smoke()
      VALID
      Sent exploit string to server to be validated.
      NICE JOB!
  </pre>
  The server will test your exploit string to make sure it really works, and
  it will update the Buffer Lab scoreboard page indicating that your userid
  (listed by your cookie for anonimity) has completed this level.&nbsp;
  <p>
  You can view the scoreboard by pointing your browser at <a href="http://cycle3.csug.rochester.edu:18213/scoreboard">http://cycle3.csug.rochester.edu:18213/scoreboard</a>
  </p><p>
  Unlike the bomb lab, there is no penalty for making mistakes in this
  lab.&nbsp; Feel free to fire away at <code>bufbomb</code> with any string you
  like.&nbsp;
  
  </p><h2>Levels</h2>
  Levels may be done in any order.&nbsp;
  <ul>
  <li><a href="level0.html">Level 0</a> (10 pts)
  </li><li><a href="level1.html">Level 1</a> (10 pts)
  </li><li><a href="level2.html">Level 2</a> (15 pts)
  </li><li><a href="level3.html">Level 3</a> (20 pts)
  </li><li><a href="level4.html">Level 4</a> (10 pts, extra credits)
  </li></ul>
  
  <h2>Logistics</h2>
  <p>
  Hand-in occurs automatically whenever you correctly solve a level <i>and</i> use the <code>-s</code> option.&nbsp;
  Upon receiving your solution, the server will validate your string and
  update the Buffer Lab scoreboard Web page, which you can view by pointing
  your Web browser at <a href="http://cycle3.csug.rochester.edu:18213/scoreboard">http://cycle3.csug.rochester.edu:18213/scoreboard</a>.&nbsp; You
  should be sure to check this page after your submission to make
  sure your string has been validated.&nbsp; (If you really solved the level, your string
  <i>should</i> be valid.)&nbsp;
  </p><p>
  Note that each level is graded individually.&nbsp; You do not need to do
  them in the specified order, but you will get credit only for the
  levels for which the server receives a valid message.&nbsp;
  </p><p>
  Have fun!
  
  <h2>Generating Byte Codes</h2>
  <p>
    Using <code>gcc</code> as an assembler and <code>objdump</code> as a
    disassembler makes it convenient to generate the byte codes for instruction
    sequences.&nbsp; For example, suppose we write a file <i>example.s</i> containing the
    following assembly code:&nbsp;
  </p>
  <pre>  # Example of hand-generated assembly code
          pushl $0x89abcdef       # Push value onto stack
          addl $17,%eax           # Add 17 to %eax
          .align 4                # Following will be aligned on multiple of 4
          .long    0xfedcba98     # A 4-byte constant
          .long    0x00000000     # Padding
  </pre>
  <p>
    The code can contain a mixture of instructions and data.&nbsp; Anything to the right
    of a ‘#’ character is a comment.&nbsp; We have added an extra word of all
    <code>0</code>s to work around a shortcoming in <code>objdump</code> to be
    described shortly.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    We can now assemble and disassemble this file:&nbsp;
  </p>
  <pre>    unix&gt; <i>gcc -c example.s</i>
      unix&gt; <i>objdump -d example.o &gt; example.d</i>
  </pre>
  <p>
    The generated file example.d contains the following lines
  </p>
  <pre>    0: 68 ef cd ab 89 push $0x89abcdef
      5: 83 c0 11       add  $0x11,%eax
      8: 98             cwtl              Objdump tries to interpret
      9: ba dc fe 00 00 mov  $0xfedc,%edx these as instructions
  </pre>
  <p>
    Each line shows a single instruction.&nbsp; The number on the left indicates the
    starting address (starting with 0), while the hex digits after the ':'
    character indicate the byte codes for the instruction.&nbsp; Thus, we can see that
    the instruction <code>pushl $0x89ABCDEF</code> has hex-formatted byte code
    <code>68 ef cd ab 89</code>.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Starting at address <code>8</code>, the disassembler gets confused.&nbsp; It tries
    to interpret the bytes in the file <i>example.o</i> as instructions, but these
    bytes actually correspond to data.&nbsp; Note, however, that if we read off the 4
    bytes starting at address <code>8</code> we get:&nbsp; <code>98 ba dc fe</code>.&nbsp; This
    is a byte-reversed version of the data word <code>0xFEDCBA98</code>.&nbsp; This byte
    reversal represents the proper way to supply the bytes as a string, since a
    little endian machine lists the least significant byte first.&nbsp; Note also that it
    only generated two of the four bytes at the end with value <code>00</code>.&nbsp; Had
    we not added this padding, <code>objdump</code> gets even more confused and
    does not emit all of the bytes we want.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, we can read off the byte sequence for our code (omitting the final
    <code>0</code>s) as:&nbsp;
  </p>
  <pre>    <code>68 ef cd ab 89 83 c0 11 98 ba dc fe</code>
  </pre>
  <h2>Turn-In</h2>
  <p>
  There is no explicit turn-in.&nbsp; The bomb will notify us automatically
  after you have successfully defused it with the <code>-s</code>
  option.&nbsp; You can keep track of how you
  (and the other groups) are doing by looking at
  <a href="http://cycle3.csug.rochester.edu:18213/scoreboard/">http://cycle3.csug.rochester.edu:18213/scoreboard/</a>.&nbsp;
