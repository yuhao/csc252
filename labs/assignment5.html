<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In this lab you will be writing a dynamic storage allocator for C
programs, i.e., your own version of the <i>malloc</i>, <i>free</i>, and
<i>realloc</i> routines.&nbsp; You are encouraged to explore the design
space creatively and implement an allocator that is correct, efficient
and fast.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>DUE DATES:</h2>
11:59pm, Monday, May 4.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Hand Out Instructions</h2>
<p>
Start by copying <i>/u/cs252/labs20/malloclab/malloclab-handout.tar</i> to a
protected directory in which you plan to do your work.&nbsp; Then give
the command:&nbsp;
</p><pre>    tar xvf malloclab-handout.tar
</pre>
This will cause a bunch of files to be unpacked into the directory.&nbsp;
The only file you will be modifying and handing in is <i>mm.c</i>.&nbsp;
<p>
The <i>mdriver.c</i> program is a driver program that allows you to
evaluate the performance of your solution.&nbsp; Use the command
<i>make</i> to generate the driver code and run it with the command
<i>./mdriver –V</i>.&nbsp; (The <i>–V</i> flag displays
helpful summary information.)
</p><p>
Looking at the file <i>mm.c</i> you’ll notice a C structure
<i>team</i> into which you should insert the requested identifying
information about the one or two individuals comprising your programming
team.&nbsp;
<b>Do this right away so you don’t forget.</b>&nbsp;
</p>

</p><h2>How to Work on the Lab</h2>
<p>
Your dynamic storage allocator will consist of the following four
functions, which are declared in <i>mm.h</i> and defined in
<i>mm.c</i>.&nbsp;
</p><ul>
<li><code>int   mm_init(void);</code>
</li><li><code>void *mm_malloc(size_t size);</code>
</li><li><code>void  mm_free(void *ptr);</code>
</li><li><code>void *mm_realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);</code>
</li></ul>

<p>
The <i>mm.c</i> file we have given you implements the simplest but
still functionally correct malloc package that we could think
of.&nbsp; Using this as a starting place, modify these functions (and
possibly define other private <i>static</i> functions), so that they
obey the following semantics:&nbsp;

</p><ul>
<p>
</p><li> <i>mm_init</i>:&nbsp; Before calling <i>mm_malloc</i>,
    <i>mm_realloc</i>, or <i>mm_free</i>, the application program (i.e.,
    the trace-driven driver program that you will use to evaluate your
    implementation) calls <i>mm_init</i> to perform any necessary
    initializations, such as allocating the initial heap area.&nbsp; The
    return value should be &#8722;1 if there was a problem in performing the
    initialization, 0 otherwise.&nbsp;
<p>

</p></li><li> <i>mm_malloc</i>:&nbsp; The <i>mm_malloc</i> routine returns a
    pointer to an allocated block payload of at least <i>size</i>
    bytes.&nbsp; The entire allocated block should lie within the heap
    region and should not overlap with any other allocated chunk.&nbsp;
    <p>
    We will compare your implementation to the version of <i>malloc</i>
    supplied in the standard C library (<i>libc</i>).&nbsp; Since the
    <i>libc malloc</i> always returns payload pointers that are aligned
    to an 8 byte boundary, your malloc implementation should do
    likewise.&nbsp;
</p><p>

</p></li><li> <i>mm_free</i>:&nbsp; The <i>mm_free</i> routine frees the block
    pointed to by <i>ptr</i>.&nbsp; It returns nothing.&nbsp; This
    routine is only guaranteed to work when the passed pointer
    (<i>ptr</i>) was returned by an earlier call to <i>mm_malloc</i> or
    <i>mm_realloc</i> and has not yet been freed.&nbsp;
<p>

</p></li><li> <i>mm_realloc</i>:&nbsp; The <i>mm_realloc</i> routine returns a
    pointer to an allocated region of at least <i>size</i> bytes with
    the following constraints:&nbsp;

    <ul>
    <p>
    </p><li> if <i>ptr</i> is NULL, the call is equivalent to
    <i>mm_malloc(size)</i>;
    <p>
    </p></li><li> if <i>size</i> is equal to zero, the call is equivalent to
    <i>mm_free(ptr)</i>;
    <p>
    </p></li><li> if <i>ptr</i> is not NULL, it must have been returned by an
    earlier call to <i>mm_malloc</i> or <i>mm_realloc</i>.&nbsp; The
    call to <i>mm_realloc</i> changes the size of the memory block
    pointed to by <i>ptr</i> (the <i>old block</i>) to <i>size</i> bytes
    and returns the address of the new block.&nbsp; Notice that the
    address of the new block might be the same as the old block, or it
    might be different, depending on your implementation, the amount of
    internal fragmentation in the old block, and the size of the
    <i>realloc</i> request.&nbsp;
    <p>
    The contents of the new block are the same as those of the old
    block, up to the minimum of the old and new sizes.&nbsp; Everything
    else is uninitialized.&nbsp; For example, if the old block is 8
    bytes and the new block is 12 bytes, then the first 8 bytes of the
    new block are identical to the first 8 bytes of the old block and
    the last 4 bytes are uninitialized (garbage).&nbsp; Similarly, if
    the old block is 8 bytes and the new block is 4 bytes, then the
    contents of the new block are identical to the first 4 bytes of the
    old block.&nbsp;
    </p></li></ul>

</li></ul>

These semantics match the the semantics of the corresponding <i>libc</i>
<i>malloc</i>, <i>realloc</i>, and <i>free</i> routines.&nbsp; Type
<i>man malloc</i> to the shell for complete documentation.&nbsp;

<h2>Heap Consistency Checker</h2><p>
</p><p>
Dynamic memory allocators are notoriously tricky beasts to program
correctly and efficiently.&nbsp; They are difficult to program correctly
because they involve a lot of untyped pointer manipulation.&nbsp; You
will find it very helpful to write a heap checker that scans the heap
and checks it for consistency.&nbsp;
</p><p>
Some examples of what a heap checker might check are:&nbsp;
</p><ul>
<li> Is every block in the free list marked as free?&nbsp;
</li><li> Are there any contiguous free blocks that somehow escaped
     coalescing?&nbsp;
</li><li> Is every free block actually in the free list?&nbsp;
</li><li> Do the pointers in the free list point to valid free blocks?&nbsp;
</li><li> Do any allocated blocks overlap?&nbsp;
</li><li> Do the pointers in a heap block point to valid heap addresses?&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>
Your heap checker will consist of the function <i>int mm_check(void)</i>
in <i>mm.c</i>.&nbsp; It will check any invariants or consistency
conditions you consider prudent.&nbsp; It returns a nonzero value if and
only if your heap is consistent.&nbsp; You are not limited to the listed
suggestions nor are you required to check all of them.&nbsp; You are
encouraged to print out error messages when <i>mm_check</i> fails.&nbsp;
</p><p>
This consistency checker is for your own debugging during
development.&nbsp; When you submit <i>mm.c</i>, make sure to remove any
calls to <i>mm_check</i> as they will slow down your throughput.&nbsp;
Style points will be given for your <i>mm_check</i> function.&nbsp; Make
sure to put in comments and document what you are checking.&nbsp;

</p><h2>Support Routines</h2>
<p>
The <i>memlib.c</i> package simulates the OS portion of the memory
system for your dynamic memory allocator.&nbsp; You can invoke the
following functions in <i>memlib.c</i>:&nbsp;

</p><ul>

<li> <i>void *mem_sbrk(int incr)</i>:&nbsp;
    Expands the heap by <i>incr</i> bytes, where <i>incr</i> is a
    positive non-zero integer and returns a generic pointer to the first
    byte of the newly allocated heap area.&nbsp; The semantics are
    based on the Unix <i>sbrk</i> function, with two notable exceptions:&nbsp;
    <ul style="font-weight:bold">
    <li>the built-in <i>sbrk</i> returns <code>-1</code> on an allocation
    error, <i>mem_sbrk</i> returns <code>NULL</code></li>
    <li><i>mem_sbrk</i> accepts only a positive non-zero integer
    argument</li>
    </ul>

</li><li> <i>void *mem_heap_lo(void)</i>:&nbsp;
    Returns a generic pointer to the first byte in the heap.&nbsp;

</li><li> <i>void *mem_heap_hi(void)</i>:&nbsp;
    Returns a generic pointer to the last byte in the heap.&nbsp;

</li><li> <i>size_t mem_heapsize(void)</i>:&nbsp;
    Returns the current size of the heap in bytes.&nbsp;

</li><li> <i>size_t mem_pagesize(void)</i>:&nbsp;
    Returns the system’s page size in bytes (4K on Linux
    systems).&nbsp;

</li></ul>

<h2>The Trace-driven Driver Program</h2>
<p>
The driver program <i>mdriver.c</i> in the <i>malloclab-handout.tar</i>
distribution tests your <i>mm.c</i> package for correctness, space
utilization, and throughput.&nbsp; The driver program is controlled by a
set of <b>trace files</b>.&nbsp; Some small traces are included in the
<i>malloclab-handout.tar</i> distribution.&nbsp; The larger traces that we will
test your file with are located at <i>/u/cs252/labs20/malloclab/malloctraces/</i>.&nbsp;
These larger traces are automatically run if you execute <i>mdriver</i>
without a <i>-f</i> argument.&nbsp; Each trace file contains a sequence of
allocate, reallocate, and free directions that instruct the driver to call
your <i>mm_malloc</i>, <i>mm_realloc</i>, and <i> mm_free</i> routines in
some sequence.&nbsp;
</p><p>
The driver <i>mdriver.c</i> accepts the following command line
arguments:&nbsp;

</p><ul>

<li> <i>–t tracedir</i>:&nbsp;
    Look for the default trace files in directory <i>tracedir</i>
    instead of the default directory defined in <i>config.h</i>.&nbsp;

</li><li> <i>–f tracefile</i>:&nbsp;
    Use one particular <i>tracefile</i> for testing instead of the
    default set of tracefiles.&nbsp;

</li><li> <i>–h</i>:&nbsp;
    Print a summary of the command line arguments.&nbsp;

</li><li> <i>–l</i>:&nbsp;
    Run and measure <i>libc</i> malloc in addition to the
    student’s malloc package.&nbsp;

</li><li> <i>–v</i>:&nbsp;
    Verbose output.&nbsp; Print a performance breakdown for each
    tracefile in a compact table.&nbsp;

</li><li> <i>–V</i>:&nbsp;
    More verbose output.&nbsp; Prints additional diagnostic information
    as each trace file is processed.&nbsp; Useful during debugging for
    determining which trace file is causing your malloc package to
    fail.&nbsp;

</li></ul>

<h2>Programming Rules</h2>

<ul>

<li> You should not change any of the interfaces in <i>mm.c</i>.&nbsp;

</li><li> You should not invoke any memory-management related library
    calls or system calls.&nbsp; This excludes the use of <i>malloc</i>,
    <i> calloc</i>, <i>free</i>, <i>realloc</i>, <i>sbrk</i>, <i>brk</i>
    or any variants of these calls in your code.&nbsp;

</li><li> You are not allowed to define any global or <i>static</i> compound
    data structures such as arrays, structs, trees, or lists in your
    <i>mm.c</i> program.&nbsp; However, you <b>are</b> allowed to
    declare global scalar variables such as integers, floats, and
    pointers in <i>mm.c</i>.&nbsp;

</li><li> For consistency with the <i>libc</i> <i>malloc</i> package, which
    returns blocks aligned on 8-byte boundaries, your allocator must
    always return pointers that are aligned to 8-byte boundaries.&nbsp;
    The driver will enforce this requirement for you.&nbsp;

</li></ul>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

You will receive <b>zero points</b> if you break any of the rules or
your code is buggy and crashes the driver.&nbsp; Otherwise, your grade
will be calculated as follows:&nbsp;

<ul>
<p>

</p><li> <b>Correctness (20 points).</b>&nbsp; You will receive full points if
    your solution passes the correctness tests performed by the driver
    program.&nbsp; You will receive partial credit for each correct
    trace.&nbsp;
<p>

</p></li><li> <b>Performance (35 points).</b>&nbsp;  Two performance metrics will be
    used to evaluate your solution:&nbsp;
    <p>
    </p><ul>
    <li> Space utilization:&nbsp; The peak ratio between the
        aggregate amount of memory used by the driver (i.e., allocated
        via <i>mm_malloc</i> or <i>mm_realloc</i> but not yet freed via
        <i>mm_free</i>) and the size of the heap used by your
        allocator.&nbsp; The optimal (unachievable) ratio would
        be&nbsp;1.&nbsp; You should find good policies to minimize
        fragmentation in order to make this ratio as close as possible to
        the optimal.&nbsp;
    </li><li>Throughput:&nbsp; The average number of operations completed
        per second.&nbsp;
    </li></ul>
    <p>
    The driver program summarizes the performance of your allocator by
    computing a <i>performance index</i>, <i>P</i>, which is a weighted sum
    of the space utilization and throughput
    </p><p>
    <i>P = wU + (1&#8722;w) min (1, T / T<sub>libc</sub>)</i>
    </p><p>
    where <i>U</i> is your space utilization, <i>T</i> is your throughput,
    and <i>T<sub>libc</sub></i> is the estimated throughput of <i>libc</i>
    malloc on your system on the default traces.&nbsp; (The value for
    <i>T<sub>libc</sub></i> is a constant in the driver (4000 Kops/s) that
    the TA established when he configured the release).&nbsp;  The
    performance index favors space utilization over throughput, with a
    default of <i>w = 0.6</i>.&nbsp;
    </p><p>
    Observing that both memory and CPU cycles are expensive system
    resources, we adopt this formula to encourage balanced optimization of
    both memory utilization and throughput.&nbsp; Ideally, the performance
    index will reach <i>P = w + (1&#8722;w) = 1</i> or <i>100%</i>.&nbsp;
    Since each metric will contribute at most <i>w</i> and <i>1&#8722;w</i>
    to the performance index, respectively, you should not go to extremes to
    optimize either the memory utilization or the throughput only.&nbsp; To
    receive a good score, you must achieve a balance between utilization and
    throughput.&nbsp; <font color="red"><b>You will receive full performance score if your performance index P is above 0.95.</b></font>
    </p><p>
    </p></li><li> <b>Style (10 points).</b>&nbsp;
        <p>
        </p><ul>
        <li>
            Your code should be decomposed into functions and use as few
            global variables as possible.&nbsp;
        </li><li>
            Your code should begin with a header comment that describes the
            structure of your free and allocated blocks, the organization of
            the free list, and how your allocator manipulates the free
            list.&nbsp;
        </li><li>
            Each subroutine should have a header comment that describes
            what it does and how it does it.&nbsp;
        </li><li>
            Your heap consistency checker <i>mm_check</i> should be
            thorough and well documented.&nbsp;
        </li></ul>
        <p>
        You will be awarded 5 points for a good heap consistency checker and
        5 points for good program structure and comments.&nbsp;
    </p></li></ul>

<h2>Hints</h2>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li> <b>Use the <i>mdriver</i> <i>–f</i> option.</b>&nbsp;  During
    initial development, using tiny trace files will simplify debugging
    and testing.&nbsp; We have included two such trace files
    (<i>short{1,2}-bal.rep</i>) that you can use for initial debugging.&nbsp;
    Other trace files are located in /u/cs252/labs20/malloclab/malloctraces/.&nbsp;
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Use the <i>mdriver</i> <i>–v</i> and <i>–V</i>
    options.</b>&nbsp; The <i>–v</i> option will give you a detailed
    summary for each trace file.&nbsp; The <i>–V</i> will also
    indicate when each trace file is read, which will help you isolate
    errors.&nbsp;
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Compile with <i>gcc –g</i> and use a debugger.</b>&nbsp;
    A debugger will help you isolate and identify out of bounds memory
    references.&nbsp;
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Understand every line of the malloc implementation in the
    textbook.</b>&nbsp;  The textbook has a detailed example of a simple
    allocator based on an implicit free list.&nbsp; Use this is a point
    of departure.&nbsp; Don’t start working on your allocator
    until you understand everything about the simple implicit list
    allocator.&nbsp;
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Encapsulate your pointer arithmetic in C preprocessor
    macros or gcc in-line functions.</b>&nbsp;  Pointer arithmetic in memory
    managers is confusing and error-prone because of all the casting that is
    necessary.&nbsp; You can reduce the complexity significantly by writing
    macros for your pointer operations.&nbsp; See the text for
    examples.&nbsp;
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Do your implementation in stages.</b>&nbsp;  The first 9 traces
    contain requests to <i>malloc</i> and <i>free</i>.&nbsp; The last 2
    traces contain requests for <i>realloc</i>, <i>malloc</i>, and
    <i>free</i>.&nbsp; We recommend that you start by getting your
    <i>malloc</i> and <i>free</i> routines working correctly and efficiently
    on the first 9 traces.&nbsp; Only then should you turn your attention to
    the <i>realloc</i> implementation.&nbsp; For starters, build
    <i>realloc</i> on top of your existing <i>malloc</i> and <i>free</i>
    implementations.&nbsp; But to get really good performance, you will need
    to build a stand-alone <i> realloc</i>.&nbsp;
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Use a profiler.</b>&nbsp; You may find the <i>gprof</i> tool helpful
    for optimizing performance.&nbsp;
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Start early!</b>&nbsp;  It is possible to write an efficient malloc
    package with a few pages of code.&nbsp; However, we can guarantee that it
    will be some of the most difficult and sophisticated code you have
    written so far in your career.&nbsp; So start early, and good luck!&nbsp;
</li></ul>
