  <h2>Level 2: Aristotle (15 pts)</h2>
  <p>

    A much more sophisticated form of buffer attack involves supplying a string
    that encodes actual machine instructions.&nbsp; The exploit string then overwrites
    the return pointer with the starting address of these instructions.&nbsp; When the
    calling function (in this case <code>getbuf</code>) executes its ret
    instruction, the program will start executing the instructions on the stack
    rather than returning.&nbsp; With this form of attack, you can get the program to
    do almost anything.&nbsp; The code you place on the stack is called the exploit
    code.&nbsp; This style of attack is tricky, though, because you must get machine
    code onto the stack and set the return pointer to the start of this code.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Within the file <code>bufbomb</code> there is a function
    <code>bang</code> having the following C code:
  </p>
  <pre>    int global_value = 0;

    void bang(int val)
    {
        if (global_value == cookie) {
            printf("Bang!: You set global_value to 0x%x\n", global_value);
            validate(2);
        } else
            printf("Misfire: global_value = 0x%x\n", global_value);
        exit(0);
    }
  </pre>
  <p>
  Similar to Level 0 and 1, your task is to get <code>bufbomb</code> to
  execute the code for <code>bang</code> rather than returning to
  <code>test</code>&nbsp; Before this, however, you must set global
  variable <code>global_value</code> to your team’s cookie.&nbsp; Your exploit code
  should set <code>global_value</code>, push the address of bang on the stack,
  and then execute a ret instruction to cause a jump to the code for bang.&nbsp;
  </p><p>
  <b>Some Advice</b>:
</p><ul>
  <li>
    You can use GDB to get the information you need to construct your exploit
    string.&nbsp; Set a breakpoint within getbuf and run to this breakpoint.&nbsp;
    Determine parameters such as the address of <code>global_value</code> and the
    location of the buffer.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    Determining the byte encoding of instruction sequences by hand is tedious
    and prone to errors.&nbsp; You can let tools do all of the work by writing an
    assembly code file containing the instructions and data you want to put on
    the stack.&nbsp; Assemble this file with GCC and disassemble it with
    <code>objdump</code>.&nbsp; You
    should be able to get the exact byte sequence that you will type at the
    prompt.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep in mind that your exploit string depends on your machine, your compiler,
    and even your team’s cookie.&nbsp; Do all of your work on a CSUG machine, and make
    sure you include the proper team name on the command line to
    <code>bufbomb</code>.&nbsp;
  </li>
<!--
  <li>
    Our solution requires 16 bytes of exploit code.&nbsp; Fortunately, there is
    sufficient space on the stack, because we can overwrite the stored value of
    <code>%ebp</code>.&nbsp; This stack corruption will not cause any
    problems, since bang causes the program to exit directly.&nbsp;
  </li>
-->
  <li>
    Watch your use of address modes when writing assembly code.&nbsp; Note that
    <code>movl $0x4, %eax</code> moves the value <code>0x00000004</code> into
    register <code>%eax</code>; whereas <code>movl 0x4, %eax</code> moves the
    value at memory location <code>0x00000004</code> into <code>%eax</code>.&nbsp;
    Since that memory location is usually undefined, the second instruction will
    cause a segfault!&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not attempt to use either a jmp or a call instruction to jump to the code
    for bang.&nbsp; These instructions uses PC-relative addressing, which is very
    tricky to set up correctly.&nbsp; Instead, push an address on the stack and use the
    <code>ret</code> instruction.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>
