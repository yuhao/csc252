  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
  The purpose of this assignment is to become more familiar with the
  concepts of process control and signaling.&nbsp; You'll do this by
  writing a simple Unix shell program that supports job control.&nbsp;
  </p>
 
  <h2>Logistics</h2>
  <p>
  As usual, you may work in a group of up to two people in solving the
  problems for this assignment.&nbsp; Any clarifications and revisions to
  the assignment will be posted to the <a href="http://my.rochester.edu/">Blackboard</a> discussion forum.&nbsp;
  </p>
 
  <h2>DUE DATES:</h2>
  <p>11:59pm, Thursday, April 6.&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>Hand Out Instructions</h2>
  <p>
  Copy the file <code>/u/cs252/labs23/shlab/shlab-handout.tar</code> to the
  protected directory in which you plan to do your work.&nbsp; Then do the
  following:&nbsp;
  </p><ul>
  <li>
  Type the command <code>tar xvf shlab-handout.tar</code> to expand the tarfile.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
  Type the command <code>make</code> to compile and link some test routines.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
  Type your team member names and CSUG IDs in the header comment at the top of
  <code>tsh.c</code>.&nbsp;
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p>
  Looking at the <code>tsh.c</code> (tiny shell) file, you will see that
  it contains a functional skeleton of a simple Unix shell.&nbsp; To help
  you get started, we have already implemented the less interesting
  functions.&nbsp; Your assignment is to complete the remaining empty
  functions.&nbsp; As a sanity check for you, we've listed the
  approximate number of lines of code for each of these functions in
  our reference solution (which includes lots of comments).&nbsp;
  </p><ul>
  <li>
  <code>eval</code>:&nbsp; Main routine that parses and interprets the command
  line.&nbsp;
  [80 lines]
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>builtin_cmd</code>:&nbsp; Recognizes and interprets the built-in
  commands <code>quit</code>, <code>fg</code>, <code>bg</code>, and
  <code>jobs</code>.&nbsp;
  [30 lines]
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>do_bgfg</code>:&nbsp; Implements the <code>bg</code> and <code>fg</code>
  built-in commands.&nbsp; [50 lines]
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>waitfg</code>:&nbsp; Waits for a foreground job to complete.&nbsp; [25 lines]
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>sigchld_handler</code>:&nbsp; Catches SIGCHILD signals.&nbsp; [75 lines]
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>sigint_handler</code>:&nbsp; Catches SIGINT (<i>ctrl</i>-<code>C</code>)
  signals.&nbsp;
  [20 lines]
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>sigtstp_handler</code>:&nbsp; Catches SIGTSTP
  (<i>ctrl</i>-<code>Z</code>) signals.&nbsp;
  [20 lines]
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p>
  Each time you modify your <code>tsh.c</code> file, type
  <code>make</code> to recompile it.&nbsp; To run your shell, type
  <code>./tsh</code> to the command line:&nbsp;
  </p><pre>    unix&gt; ./tsh
      tsh&gt; <code>[type commands to your shell here]</code>
  </pre>
  If you want to exit your shell, but have not implemented the appropriate
  commands, you can type <i>ctrl</i>-<code>D</code> or (more harshly)
  <i>ctrl</i>-<code>C</code> to kill your shell.&nbsp;
  <p></p>
  
  <h2>General Overview of Unix Shells</h2>
  <p>
  A <i>shell</i> is an interactive command-line interpreter that runs
  programs on behalf of the user.&nbsp; A shell repeatedly prints a
  prompt, waits for a <i>command line</i> on <i>stdin</i>, and then
  carries out some action, as directed by the contents of the command
  line.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
  The command line is a sequence of ASCII text words delimited by
  whitespace.&nbsp; The first word in the command line is either the name
  of a built-in command or the pathname of an executable file.&nbsp; The
  remaining words are command-line arguments.&nbsp; If the first word is a
  built-in command, the shell immediately executes the command in the
  current process.&nbsp; Otherwise, the word is assumed to be the pathname
  of an executable program.&nbsp; In this case, the shell forks a child
  process, then loads and runs the program in the context of the
  child.&nbsp; The child processes created as a result of interpreting a
  single command line are known collectively as a <i>job</i>.&nbsp; In
  general, a job can consist of multiple child processes connected by Unix
  pipes.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
  If the command line ends with an ampersand &amp;, then the job runs in
  the <i>background</i>, which means that the shell does not wait for the
  job to terminate before printing the prompt and awaiting the next
  command line.&nbsp; Otherwise, the job runs in the <i>foreground</i>,
  which means that the shell waits for the job to terminate before
  prompting for the next command line.&nbsp; Thus, at any point in time,
  at most one job can be running in the foreground.&nbsp; However, an
  arbitrary number of jobs can run in the background.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
  For example, typing the command line
  </p><pre>    tsh&gt; <code>jobs</code>
  </pre>
  causes the shell to execute the built-in <code>jobs</code>
  command.&nbsp; Typing the command line
  <pre>    tsh&gt; <code>/bin/ls -l -d</code>
  </pre>
  runs the <code>ls</code> program in the foreground.&nbsp; By convention,
  the shell ensures that when <code>ls</code> begins executing its main
  routine:&nbsp;
  <pre>    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  </pre>
  the <code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code> arguments have the following
  values:&nbsp;
  <ul>
  <li><code>argc == 3</code></li>
  <li><code>argv[0] == "/bin/ls"</code></li>
  <li><code>argv[1] == "-l"</code></li>
  <li><code>argv[2] == "-d"</code></li>
  </ul>
  Alternatively, typing the command line
  <pre>    tsh&gt; <code>/bin/ls -l -d &amp;</code>
  </pre>
  runs the <code>ls</code> program in the background.&nbsp;
  <p></p>
  <p>
  Unix shells support the notion of <i>job control</i>, which allows users
  to move jobs back and forth between background and foreground, and to
  change the process state (running, stopped, or terminated) of the
  processes in a job.&nbsp; Typing <i>ctrl</i>-<code>C</code> causes a
  SIGINT signal to
  be delivered to each process in the foreground job.&nbsp; The default
  action for SIGINT is to terminate the process.&nbsp; Similarly, typing
  <i>ctrl</i>-<code>Z</code> causes a SIGTSTP signal to be delivered to
  each process in
  the foreground job.&nbsp; The default action for SIGTSTP is to place a
  process in the stopped state, where it remains until it is awakened by
  the receipt of a SIGCONT signal.&nbsp; Unix shells also provide various
  built-in commands that support job control.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp;
  </p><ul>
  <li>
  <code>jobs</code>:&nbsp; List the running and stopped background jobs.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>bg &lt;job&gt;</code>:&nbsp; Change a stopped background job to a running
  background job.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>fg &lt;job&gt;</code>:&nbsp; Change a stopped or running background job to a
  running foreground job.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>kill &lt;job&gt;</code>:&nbsp; Terminate a job.&nbsp;
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <h2>The <code>tsh</code> Specification</h2>
  <p>
  Your <code>tsh</code> shell should have the following features:&nbsp;
  </p><ul>
  <li>The prompt should be the string <code>tsh&gt; </code>.</li>
  <li>
  The command line typed by the user should consist of a <i>name</i> and
  zero or more arguments, all separated by one or more spaces.&nbsp; If
  <i>name</i> is a built-in command, then <code>tsh</code> should handle
  it immediately and wait for the next command line.&nbsp; Otherwise,
  <code>tsh</code> should assume that <i>name</i> is the path of an
  executable file, which it loads and runs in the context of an initial
  child process.&nbsp; (In this context, the term <i>job</i> refers to this
  initial child process.)&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>tsh</code> need not support pipes (<code>|</code>) or I/O redirection
  (<code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>).
  </li>
  <li>
  Typing <i>ctrl</i>-<code>C</code> (<i>ctrl</i>-<code>Z</code>) should
  cause a SIGINT (SIGTSTP)
  signal to be sent to the current foreground job, as well as any
  descendents of that job (e.g., any child processes that it
  forked).&nbsp; If there is no foreground job (i.e., <code>tsh</code> is
  in the foreground), then the signal should
  have no effect.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
  If the command line ends with an ampersand, then <code>tsh</code> should
  run the job in the background.&nbsp; Otherwise, it should run the job in
  the foreground.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
  Each job can be identified by either a process ID (PID) or a job ID
  (JID), which is a small positive integer assigned by
  <code>tsh</code>.&nbsp; JIDs should be denoted on the command line by
  the prefix %.&nbsp; For example,  <i>%5</i>
  denotes JID 5, and <i>5</i> denotes PID 5.&nbsp; (We have
  provided you with all of the routines you need for manipulating the job
  list.)&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>tsh</code> should support the following built-in commands:&nbsp;
  <ul>
  <li>
  The <code>quit</code> command terminates the shell.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
  The <code>jobs</code> command lists all background jobs.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
  The <code>bg &lt;job&gt;</code> command restarts <code>&lt;job&gt;</code> by
  sending it a SIGCONT signal, and then runs it in the background.&nbsp; The
  <code>&lt;job&gt;</code> argument can be either a PID or a JID.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
  The <code>fg &lt;job&gt;</code> command restarts <code>&lt;job&gt;</code> by
  sending it a SIGCONT signal, and then runs it in the foreground.&nbsp;
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li><li>
  <code>tsh</code> should reap all of its zombie children.&nbsp; If any
  job terminates because it receives a signal that it didn't catch,
  then <code>tsh</code> should recognize this event and print a message
  with the job's PID and a description of the offending
  signal.&nbsp;
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <h2>Checking Your Work</h2>
  <p>
  We have provided some tools to help you check your work.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Reference solution.</b>&nbsp; The Linux executable <code>tshref</code> is
  the reference solution for the shell.&nbsp; Run this program to resolve
  any questions you have about how your shell should behave.&nbsp; <font color="red"><b><i>Your
  shell should emit output that is identical to the reference
  solution</i></b></font>
  (modulo PIDs, of course, which change from run to run).&nbsp;
  Past experience indicates that obtaining exact correspondence is
  difficult.&nbsp;  In some cases one might argue that different output
  would be equally good; even so, for the sake of the
  TA's sanity, you will receive full
  credit only for matching the reference solution.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Shell driver.</b>&nbsp; The <code>sdriver.pl</code> program (a perl script)
  executes a shell as a child process, sends it commands and signals as
  directed by a <i>trace file</i>, and captures and displays the output from
  the shell.&nbsp;
  </p><pre>    unix&gt; ./sdriver.pl -h
      Usage: sdriver.pl [-hv] -t &lt;trace&gt; -s &lt;shellprog&gt; -a &lt;args&gt;
      Options:
        -h            Print this message
        -v            Be more verbose
        -t &lt;trace&gt;    Trace file
        -s &lt;shell&gt;    Shell program to test
        -a &lt;args&gt;     Shell arguments
        -g            Generate output for autograder
  </pre>
  <p></p>
  <p>
  We have also provided 16 trace files (<code>trace{01-16}.txt</code>) that you
  will use in conjunction with the shell driver to test the correctness of your
  shell.&nbsp; The lower-numbered trace files do very simple tests, and the
  higher-numbered tests do more complicated tests.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
  You can run the shell driver on your shell using trace file
  <code>trace01.txt</code> (for instance) by typing:&nbsp;
  </p><pre>    unix&gt; <code>./sdriver.pl -t trace01.txt -s ./tsh -a "-p"</code>
  </pre>
  or
  <pre>    unix&gt; <code>make test01</code>
  </pre>
  (The <code>-a "-p"</code> argument tells your shell not to emit a
  prompt.)&nbsp; And, if you want to run all of the tests on your shell,
  you can type:&nbsp;
  <pre>    unix&gt; <code>make tests</code>
  </pre>
  Similarly, you can run the trace driver on the reference shell by typing:&nbsp;
  <pre>    unix&gt; <code>./sdriver.pl -t trace01.txt -s ./tshref -a "-p"</code>
  </pre>
  or
  <pre>    unix&gt; <code>make rtest01</code>
  </pre>
  And you can run all the tests on the reference shell by typing
  <pre>    unix&gt; <code>make rtests</code>
  </pre>
  For your reference, <code>tshref.out</code> gives the output of the
  reference solution on all 16 traces.&nbsp; This might be more convenient
  for you than running the shell driver.&nbsp;
  <p></p>
  <p>
  The neat thing about the trace files is that they generate the same
  output you would have gotten had you run your shell interactively
  (except for an initial comment that identifies the trace).&nbsp; For
  example:&nbsp;
  </p><pre>    unix&gt; make test15
      ./sdriver.pl -t trace15.txt -s ./tsh -a "-p"
      #
      # trace15.txt - Putting it all together
      #
      tsh&gt; ./bogus
      ./bogus: Command not found.
      tsh&gt; ./myspin 10
      Job (9721) terminated by signal: Interrupt
      tsh&gt; ./myspin 3 &amp;
      [1] (9723) ./myspin 3 &amp;
      tsh&gt; ./myspin 4 &amp;
      [2] (9725) ./myspin 4 &amp;
      tsh&gt; jobs
      [1] (9723) Running    ./myspin 3 &amp;
      [2] (9725) Running    ./myspin 4 &amp;
      tsh&gt; fg %1
      Job [1] (9723) stopped by signal: Stopped
      tsh&gt; jobs
      [1] (9723) Stopped    ./myspin 3 &amp;
      [2] (9725) Running    ./myspin 4 &amp;
      tsh&gt; bg %3
      %3: No such job
      tsh&gt; bg %1
      [1] (9723) ./myspin 3 &amp;
      tsh&gt; jobs
      [1] (9723) Running    ./myspin 3 &amp;
      [2] (9725) Running    ./myspin 4 &amp;
      tsh&gt; fg %1
      tsh&gt; quit
      unix&gt;
  </pre>
  
  
  <!--<h2>Note</h2>
  <p>
  In the shell assignment as defined by the authors, you were not required
  to change ownership of the terminal.&nbsp; That meant that your processes
  wouldn’t
  be able to read from the terminal.&nbsp;  You were to leave the terminal
  attached to the shell, which would catch SIGINT and SIGSTP, and forward
  them to the process group it is <i>pretending</i> is in the
  foreground.&nbsp;
  We’re requiring you to fix that this year.&nbsp; There’s one
  test case (<code>myhello.c</code>) that accepts user input; it’s
  worth 10 pts.&nbsp; Your shell should
  correctly handle this test case.&nbsp;
  </p>-->
  
  <h2>Hints</h2>
  <p>
  </p><ul>
  <li>
  Read Chapter 8 (Exceptional Control Flow) in the textbook carefully.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
  Use the trace files to guide the development of your shell.&nbsp;
  Starting with <code>trace01.txt</code>, make sure that your shell
  produces the <i>identical</i> output as the reference shell.&nbsp; Then
  move on to trace file <code>trace02.txt</code>, and so on.&nbsp;
  </li>
  
  <li>
  The <code>psignal</code>, <code>waitpid</code>, <code>kill</code>,
  <code>fork</code>, <code>execve</code>, <code>setpgid</code>,
  <code>sigprocmask</code>, and <code>tcsetpgrp</code> functions will come
  in very handy.&nbsp; The
  WUNTRACED and WNOHANG options to <code>waitpid</code> will also be
  useful.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
  Programs such as <code>more</code>, <code>less</code>, <code>vi</code>,
  and <code>emacs</code> do strange things with the terminal
  settings.&nbsp; Don't run these programs from your shell.&nbsp;
  Stick with simple text-based programs such <code>/bin/ls</code>,
  <code>/bin/ps</code>, and <code>/bin/echo</code>.&nbsp; If you run one
  of the others by accident, you <i>may</i> be able to get back to normal by
  typing <code>stty reset</code>.&nbsp; In the worst case, you may need to
  terminate your terminal session and log back in again.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
  When you run your shell from the standard Unix shell, your shell is
  running in the foreground process group.&nbsp; If your shell then
  creates a child process, by default that child will also be a member of
  the foreground process group.&nbsp; Since typing
  <i>ctrl</i>-<code>C</code> sends a
  SIGINT to every process in the foreground group, typing
  <i>ctrl</i>-<code>C</code>
  will send a SIGINT to your shell, as well as to every process that your
  shell created, which obviously isn't correct.&nbsp;
  <br>
  Here is the solution:&nbsp; After the <code>fork</code>, but before the
  <code>execve</code>, the child process should call <code>setpgid(0,
  0)</code>, which puts the child in a new process group whose group ID is
  identical to the child's PID.&nbsp;
  If the child is to run in the foreground, it should then call
  <code>tcsetpgrp(0, my_pid)</code>.&nbsp;
  This ensures that
  when you type <i>ctrl</i>-<code>C</code>, the resulting SIGINT goes
  either to your shell or to the appropriate foreground job (more
  precisely, the process group that contains the foreground job), as
  appropriate.&nbsp;
  Note that you will need to call <code>tcsetpgrp</code> again after
  reaping a foreground job.&nbsp;  If you read the man page, you'll notice
  that a process gets a SIGTTOU signal whenever it calls <code>tcsetpgrp</code> 
  from the background; to avoid this, you will need to call
  <code>signal</code> once in your shell, during startup, to explicitly
  ignore SIGTTOU.&nbsp; 
  </li>
  <li>
  You may notice that <code>tcsetpgrp</code> fails when testing your shell
  with the given test script.&nbsp; This is a known problem with the
  script.&nbsp; It should not, however, prevent you from correctly running
  any of the <code>trace*.txt</code> files, as they take no user input.&nbsp;
  Your shell must, however, display correct behavior on programs, both
  foreground and background, that do take user input including correct
  handling of <i>ctrl</i>-<code>C</code> and
  <i>ctrl</i>-<code>Z</code> events entered at the keyboard.&nbsp; We will
  be testing these behaviors manually.&nbsp; If you are not sure what the
  correct behavior ought to be, try the same operations in
  your favorite Linux shell.&nbsp;
  </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Evaluation</h2>
  <p>
  Your score will be computed out of a maximum of 90 points based on the
  following distribution:&nbsp;
  </p><ul>
  <li>[80] Correctness:&nbsp; 16 trace files at 5 points each. </li>
  <li>[10] Style points.&nbsp; We expect you to have good comments (5 pts)
  and to check the return value of every system call (5 pts).</li>
  </ul>
  Your solution shell will be tested for correctness on a CSUG Linux
  machine (likely cycle1), using the same shell driver and trace files
  that were included in your lab directory.&nbsp; Your shell should
  produce <b>identical</b> output on these traces as the reference shell,
  with only two exceptions:&nbsp;
  <ul>
  <li>The PIDs can (and will) be different.</li>
  <li>
  The output of the <code>/bin/ps</code> commands in
  <code>trace11.txt</code>, <code>trace12.txt</code>, and
  <code>trace13.txt</code> will be different from run to run.&nbsp;
  However, the running states of any <code>mysplit</code> processes in the
  output of the <code>/bin/ps</code> command should be identical.&nbsp;
  </li>
  </ul>
  We reserve the right to run additional checks if we suspect that your program
  generates the right output for the wrong reason.&nbsp;
  <p></p>
