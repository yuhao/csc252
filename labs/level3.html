<h2>Level 3:&nbsp; Cynicism (20 pts)</h2>
<p>
  Our preceding attacks have all caused the program to jump to the code for
  some other function, which then causes the program to exit.&nbsp; As a result, it
  was acceptable to use exploit strings that corrupt the stack, overwriting
  the saved value of register <code>%ebp</code> and the return pointer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The most sophisticated form of buffer overflow attack causes the program to
  execute some exploit code that patches up the stack and makes the program
  return to the original calling function (test in this case).&nbsp; The calling
  function is oblivious to the attack.&nbsp; This style of attack is tricky, though,
  since you must:&nbsp;
  </p><ol>
    <li>get machine code onto the stack,</li>
    <li>set the return pointer to the start of this code, and</li>
    <li>undo the corruptions made to the stack state.</li>
  </ol>
<p></p>
<p>
  Your job for this level is to supply an exploit string that will cause
  <code>getbuf</code> to return your cookie back to <code>test</code>, rather
  than the value 1.&nbsp; You can see in the code for test that this will cause the
  program to go “Boom!”&nbsp; Your exploit code should set your cookie as the return
  value, restore any corrupted state, push the correct return location on the
  stack, and execute a <code>ret</code> instruction to really return to test.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <b>Some Advice</b>:&nbsp;
  </p><ul>
    <li>
      In order to overwrite the return pointer, you must also overwrite the
      saved value of <code>%ebp</code>.&nbsp; However, it is important that this value
      is correctly restored before you return to test.&nbsp; You can do this by either
      <ol>
        <li>
          making sure that your exploit string contains the correct value of the
          saved <code>%ebp</code> in the correct position, so that it never gets
          corrupted, <b>or</b>
        </li>
        <li>restore the correct value as part of your exploit code.</li>
      </ol>
      You’ll see that the code for test has some explicit tests to check for a
      corrupted stack.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      You can use <code>gdb</code> to get the information you need to construct
      your exploit string.&nbsp; Set a breakpoint within <code>getbuf</code> and run to
      this breakpoint.&nbsp; Determine parameters such as the saved return address and
      the saved value of <code>%ebp</code>.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      Again, let tools such as <code>gcc</code> and <code>objdump</code> do all
      of the work of generating a byte encoding of the instructions.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep in mind that your exploit string depends on your machine, your
      compiler, and even your team’s cookie.&nbsp; Do all of your work on a CSUG
      machine, and make sure you include the proper team name on the command line
      to <code>bufbomb</code>.&nbsp;
    </li>
  </ul>
<p></p>
<p>
  Once you complete this level, pause to reflect on what you have accomplished.&nbsp;
  You caused a program to execute machine code of your own design.&nbsp; You have done
  so in a sufficiently stealthy way that the program did not realize that
  anything was amiss.&nbsp;
