<h2>Level 4: Cyrenaicism (10 pts Extra Credit)</h2>
<p>
  If you have completed the first four levels, you have earned 55
  points (full credit).&nbsp; You
  have mastered the principles of the runtime stack operation, and you have
  gained firsthand experience with buffer overflow attacks.&nbsp; We consider this a
  satisfactory mastery of the material.&nbsp; You are welcome to stop right now.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The next level is to conquer Mesopotamia. It is for those who want to push themselves beyond our baseline
  expectations for the course, and who want to face a challenge in designing
  buffer overflow attacks that arises in real life.&nbsp; This part of the assignment
  only counts 10 points, even though it requires a fair amount of work to do, so
  don’t do it just for the points.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  From one run to another, especially by different users, the exact stack
  positions used by a given procedure will vary.&nbsp; One reason for this variation
  is that the values of all environment variables are placed near the base of
  the stack when a program starts executing.&nbsp; Environment variables are stored as
  strings, requiring different amounts of storage depending on their values.&nbsp;
  Thus, the stack space allocated for a given user depends on the settings of
  his or her environment variables.&nbsp; Stack positions also differ when running a
  program under <code>gdb</code>, since <code>gdb</code> uses stack space for
  some of its own state.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  In the code that calls <code>getbuf</code>, we have incorporated features that
  stabilize the stack, so that the position of <code>getbuf</code>’s stack frame
  will be consistent between runs.&nbsp; This made it possible for you to write an
  exploit string knowing the exact starting address of <code>buf</code> and the
  exact saved value of <code>%ebp</code>.&nbsp; If you tried to use such an exploit on
  a normal program, you would find that it works some times, but it causes
  segmentation faults at other times.&nbsp; Hence the name
  “dynamite”—an explosive
  developed by Alfred Nobel that contains stabilizing elements to make it less
  prone to unexpected explosions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  For this level, we have gone the opposite direction, making the stack
  positions even less stable than they normally are.&nbsp; Hence the name
  “nitroglycerin”—an explosive that is notoriously unstable.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  When you run <code>bufbomb</code> with the command line flag
  “-n,” it will run in “Nitro” mode.&nbsp; Rather than
  calling the function <code>getbuf</code>, the
  program calls a slightly different function <code>getbufn</code>:
</p>
<pre>  int getbufn()
  {
      char buf[KABOOM_BUFFER_SIZE];
      Gets(buf);
      return 1;
  }
</pre>
<p>
  This function is similar to <code>getbuf</code>, except that it has a buffer
  of 512 characters.&nbsp; You will need this additional space to create a reliable
  exploit.&nbsp; The code that calls <code>getbufn</code> first allocates a random amount of storage
  on the stack (using library function <code>alloca</code>) that ranges between
  0 and 255 bytes.&nbsp; Thus, if you were to sample the value of <code>%ebp</code>
  during two successive executions of <code>getbufn</code>, you would find they
  differ by as much as [&#8722;127, 127] bytes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  In addition, when run in Nitro mode, <code>bufbomb</code> requires you to
  supply your string 5 times, and it will execute <code>getbufn</code> 5 times,
  each with a different stack offset.&nbsp; Your exploit string must make it return
  your cookie each of these times.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Your task is identical to the task for the Dynamite level.&nbsp; Once again, your job
  for this level is to supply an exploit string that will cause
  <code>getbufn</code> to return your cookie back to test, rather than the value
  1.&nbsp; You can see in the code for <code>test</code> that this will cause the program to go
  “KABOOM!”&nbsp; Your exploit code should set your cookie as the return value,
  restore any corrupted state, push the correct return location on the stack, and
  execute a <code>ret</code> instruction to really return to
  <code>test</code>.&nbsp;


</p><p>
  <b>Some Advice</b>:
  </p><ul>
    <li>
      You can use the program <code>hex2raw</code> to send multiple copies
      of your exploit string.&nbsp; If you have a single copy in the file
      <i>exploit.txt</i>, then you can use the following command:
      <pre>    unix&gt; <i>cat exploit.txt</i> | <i>hex2raw -n</i> | <i>bufbomb -n -u bovik</i></pre>
      You must use the same string for all 5 executions of
  <code>getbufn</code>.&nbsp;
      Otherwise it will fail the testing code used by our grading server.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      The trick is to make use of the <code>nop</code> instruction.&nbsp; It is
      encoded with a single byte (code <code>0x90</code>).&nbsp; You can place a long
      sequence of these at the beginning of your exploit code so that your code
      will work correctly if the initial jump lands anywhere within the sequence.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      You will need to restore the saved value of <code>%ebp</code> in a way that
      is insensitive to variations in stack positions.&nbsp;
      </li>
  </ul>
